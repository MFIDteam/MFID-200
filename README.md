## Intorduction
The multimodal footprint dataset (MFID-200) of 200 subjects, which contains single-pressure footprints, serial-pressure footprints, and optical footprints, for a total of about 23,200 images and 157,600 footprints. The MFID-200 is built at the Footprint Sensing and Analysis Laboratory of Anhui University, where we use a single-pressure footprint collection device, a serial-pressure footprint collection device, and an optical footprint collection device to collect footprints.
